# Complex System and Networks - M.Sc. Physics University of Delhi

## Semester: III Course Code: PH-OT543

### Course Instructor : Professor Sanjay Jain [>Profile<](http://people.du.ac.in/~jain/)

#### Assisted by his PhD students: Angad Yuvraj Singh, Shagun Nagpal and Hemant Kumar

As per our university syllabus, "This course deals with the interdisciplinary subject of complex systems, that include, among others, living organisms, ecosystems and human societies. The course emphasizes a unifying theme – complex networks – that cuts across all these systems. It develops the mathematical tools of graph theory and dynamical systems to provide insight into the structure, dynamics and evolution of a variety of complex systems in the physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences and engineering."

We have been given practice problems to simulate in Python3 using Jupyter Notebook for a better and deep understanding of the paper and here I'll commit the scripts as I successfully compile and get the desired output.<br>
***This repository is under progress.***
