# Complex System and Networks - M.Sc. Physics University of Delhi

## Semester: III Course Code: PH-OT543

As per our university syllabus, "This course deals with the interdisciplinary subject of complex systems, that include, among others, living organisms, ecosystems and human societies. The course emphasizes a unifying theme – complex networks – that cuts across all these systems. It develops the mathematical tools of graph theory and dynamical systems to provide insight into the structure, dynamics and evolution of a variety of complex systems in the physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences and engineering."

We has being given practice problems to simulate in Python3 using Jupyter Notebook for a better and deep understanding of the paper and here I'll commit the scripts as I successfully compile and get the desired output.<br>
***This repository is under progress.***
